    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>3D Modell designed with the help of Fusion 360</p>
    <p>Though during the process of Manufacturing the financial budget of the Project couldn't allow us to build it exactly as planned.</p>
    <p>This lead us to use budget frendly material such as wood as the base plate of the Test Bench</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software: Fusion 360</li>
      <li>Material used:Aluminium T-slots, wood and an Aluminium Sheet as the Motor secondry</li>
    </ul>
